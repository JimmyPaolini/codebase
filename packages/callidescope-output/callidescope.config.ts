 * What callidescope-output is held to, measured rather than assumed.

 * Ten frames from a finding to the markdown that states it.
 *
 * Measured by a run scoped to this project and its dependency closure, and set
 * **at** what it measured rather than above it: a stack at the limit passes, so
 * this gate is green the day it arrives and the number is a starting point to
 * ratchet down from rather than a target to grow into.
 *
 * @see configuration/callidescope.config.ts — the limits this file falls back
 * to for everything it does not name, and why it neither spreads nor imports
 * them
