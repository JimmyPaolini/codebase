 * limit passes, so this gate is green the day it arrives and each number is a
 * starting point to ratchet down from rather than a target to grow into.
 *
 * Four direct callees at the widest — ordinary fan-out rather than a closed
 * enumeration, so the next helper anybody extracts here is what moves the
 * number.
